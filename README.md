# Lexifer

This is a word generator for conlangers, written in Python 3.

This is a fork of W. Annis's word generator. See bbrk24's [the typescript web app](https://lingweenie.org/conlang/lexifer-app.html) if that is more suitable for you.

I hope to add additional functionality and features to my fork of it and make the code more accessable and documented, and of course get rid of some bugs I found.

# Generating words

- Change the dict in the settings.py file to what you want and run lexifer-run as a module, e.g: `python lexifer.run`
